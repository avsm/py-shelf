### 0.0.8 (released 2008-01-10)

New icon, thanks Rui.

I'm sure there was something else. I decide I should start keeping a ChangeLog.

### 0.0.9 (under development)

Companies in the address book are recognised as such, and display the company
name first. They have a different default icon.

Mattb had an odd crashing bug that I don't understand, where there seemed to be
no 'active application'. I'm now guarding against this case.

The NetNewsWire clue provider now tries to find a person based on the target of
the currently viewed headline first, then falls back to the feed URL, rather
than just using the feed URL.

The NetNewsWire provider now looks for Microformats in the body of the feed
item before considering URLs. I may reconsider the ordering here, though.

Hopefully better URL disambiguation now - www. on the beginning of addresses
can be considered optional.

The display will hang around a little longer if it thinks you're no longer
looking at someone interesting, to try to bridge the gap if you're navigating
to a resource about the same person.
