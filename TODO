flickr userid / username disambiguation, somehow? Do they result in the same feed url?

Sort out licenses!

display online/offline status if possible.

use gravatar to fetch picture if there's nothing in addressbook

consider: maybe it's not worth displaying the window if we have nothing useful to say?

rename 'atom' to 'block' everywhere

blocks maybe want a little 'refresh' icon on them?

Guessed blocks have the 'G' symbol. clicking this symbol should offer to add
it to the address book card.
