flickr userid / username disambiguation, somehow? Do they result in the same feed url?

Sort out licenses!

display online/offline status if possible.

use gravatar to fetch picture if there's nothing in addressbook

consider: maybe it's not worth displaying the window if we have nothing useful to say?

rename 'atom' to 'block' everywhere

blocks maybe want a little 'refresh' icon on them?

blocks from google need to indicate that they're not primary, and should offer to add themselves

dedupe feeds based on url uniqueness.

under safari, parse rel="me" lnks for more urls for the clue
