special case the twitter sending in the adium cluepacket source - IMs from

Can I get the source of the current firefox page, for microformat parsing?

google social is suggesting pages for people that don't then link back to them.
Am I doing something wrong in the API? If not, is this a Google bug? Even if so,
I should remember how I got these urls, so they link back for me.


22:56 <@muttley> I actually want something passive
22:57 <@blech> how?
22:57 <@muttley> then I can either highlight something or not
22:57 <@muttley> and then hit a key combo and it would bring up the window with
                 the clues
22:58 <@muttley> I think a constant stream of clues might end up being too
                 distracting
22:58 <@blech> jerakeen: good lord you weren't kidding
22:59 <@blech> muttley: I see
22:59 <@muttley> I'm wondering if Shelf could be redone so you could have an
                 Expose like system
22:59 <@blech> it's not that you don't want it accessing the web, it's that you
               only want it to scan for context when asked
22:59 <@muttley> so when you hit Apple-S or whatever
23:00 <@muttley> you can an Exposes like overlay with all the clues arranged in
                 a grid
23:00 <@muttley> blech: it could either scan continuously or not
23:00 <@blech> muttley: right, but you want that option
23:00 <@blech> at the moment it's always active
23:00 <@muttley> I'm wondering if you could have a backend
23:01 <@muttley> and then you could either have a window that's constantly
                 updating
23:01 <@muttley> or an Exposes style system
23:01 <@muttley> that's either constantly updating or on demand
23:01 <@muttley> jerakeen: you refactored it to be a more clue based system?
