The Shelf source code repository includes imported snapshots of the following libraries:

autorss.py - Copyright 2002, Mark Pilgrim, licensed under the Python license.

feedparser.py - Copyright 2002-2006, Mark Pilgrim, licensed under something that looks like the 3-clause BSD licence with the no-endorsement clause removed

microformatparser.py - Copyright 2005, Phil Dawes, 'Distributed under a New BSD style license'

Shelf uses the simplejson library (http://www.undefined.org/python/). It's not included
in the source tree, but building shelf requires it to be installed, and the library
is built into the .app binary. simplesjson is copyright 2006, Bob Ippolito, licensed under the X11/MIT license.


Given all this, Shelf needs a license. Python? Still thinking about it. Please
don't submit any patches unless you're willing to have them licensed under something
random that I think of later.
